# Hey there!

Welcome to my github. This repository is the home of my personal website which is hosted through Gitlab Pages.
Feel free to look around and see all of the stuff I have been up to!
Thanks for visiting!

## Personal Website

This website is created using [Vite](https://vite.dev/) and Vue3 and uses the [PrimeVue](https://primevue.org/checkbox/) component library.
For the blog portion, I write the blogs in markdown and use an HTML to markdown renderer to display them in the browser.

## Building

Run locally with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Create a release with
```bash
npm run build
```

This command is used in `deploy.sh` when publishing to Github pages.
